"<em>terms</em> (the blog tags or recipe ingredients in these "
"examples); and a set of terms is known as a <em>vocabulary</em> (the "
"set of all blog post tags, or the set of all recipe ingredients in "
"these examples). Technically, taxonomy terms are an entity type and "
"the entity subtypes are the vocabularies; see @content_structure_topic "

"have fields attached; for instance, you could set up an image field to "
